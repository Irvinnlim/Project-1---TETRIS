## Project Title
This is a classic game of TETRIS with the aim of clearing as many lines of tetris blocks as possible.

## Features of Game
The game comprises a 20 by 10 board. When game is initiated, random tetromino blocks (I,J,L,O,S,T,Z) will appear and they will automatically descend. You are allowed to move/ rotate the tetromino blocks if the move is valid. Your aim is to clear as many rows as possible to attain as many points as possible.

## Gameplay
To begin, click on the "Play" button.
Press the LEFT arrow key to move the tetromino to the left.
Press the RIGHT arrow key to move the tetromino to the right.
Press the UP arrow key to rotate the tetromino.
Press the DOWN KEY to move the tetromino downwards.

### Visualising Tetromino Blocks' Rotations

## Scoring System
Scores are awarded based on the number of lines cleared per time;

SINGLE       : 40,
DOUBLE       : 100,
TRIPLE       : 300,
TETRIS(QUAD) : 1200

## Future Features
(1) Display next tetromino block to be spawned, (2) level up, (3) rate of descend increases with each level.

## Motivations for Creating the Game
This is my first javascript project. As I embarked on this project as part of my Software Engineering Immersive programme with General Assembly, I wanted to test myself to build a game that requires translation, keycode controls, functions, callbacks and DOM manipulation. TETRIS ticked all the boxes. 

Furthermore, TETRIS is a classic game that my Fiancee loves and hence, it gives me great joy to make this game for her.
