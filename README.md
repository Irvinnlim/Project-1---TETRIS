## Motivations for Creating the Game
This is my first javascript project. As I embarked on this project as part of my Software Engineering Immersive programme with General Assembly, I wanted to test myself to build a game that requires translation, keycode controls, functions, callbacks and DOM manipulation. TETRIS ticked all the boxes. 

Furthermore, TETRIS is a classic game that my Fiancee loves and hence, it gives me great joy to make this game for her.
